            There’s not one single answer to this question. A website design is
            quoted based on the needs of each individual project. Every website
            is unique and requires different components; we design and develop
            custom websites specifically for your small business. We’ll ask a
            lot of questions, assess your needs, and give you a quote based on
            that assessment. Most of our sites run in the ₹5,000 – ₹12,000
            range, but can be more or less depending on needs.

            For most projects, equal payments are made at the start, midway, and
            the end of the project, but we can work with you to set up a
            schedule that meets your needs. We understand that this is a big
            investment and want to help you budget for the expense in whatever
            way possible. We accept checks, PayPal, and all major credit cards.

            Usually that is you. You are the expert on your business, so it’s usually best if it comes from you. If you need help, we can recommend copywriters who can help clean up or write original content for you at an additional cost.
